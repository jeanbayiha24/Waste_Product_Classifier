# Waste Classification Using Transfer Learning

## Introduction
The aim of the project is to develop an automated waste classification model that can accurately differentiate between recyclable and organic waste based on images. The project will use transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify images

## Project Overview
EcoClean's manual waste sorting process is labor-intensive and error-prone. This solution leverages computer vision to:
- Reduce contamination rates
- Improve sorting efficiency
- Automate waste classification

**Final Output**: A trained model achieving >90% accuracy in waste classification.

## Setup

### Installing Required Libraries
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pillow
```

## Dataset
The dataset contains images of:
- Recyclable waste (plastic, metal, paper)
- Organic waste (food scraps, yard waste)
